# A-Comparative-Study-of-Makeup-Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-

## Abstract
Image Classification is widely use in our daily life, which includes from taking daily photo of a beautiful phenomenon to medical image analysis, to autonomous driving for allowing the further development of automated technology. Image classification uses the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks due to the high performances on large images. The goal of image classification is to assign the given image by applying a specific label to it. Image classification requires a complex procedure which depends on different components. We proposed re-training of two different CNN architecture which is Alexnet and VGG and compare the result to see which model fit better to the dataset. Hyper-parameter tuning according with different model to obtain optimum and reasonable accuracy.

#### Keywords: Image Classification, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep learning, Alexnet, VGG
